                                            The Lebanese civil war began on 13 April 1975, two weeks 
                                            before the end of the war with Vietnam. In the afternoon of 4 June 1982 Israeli forces raided and two days later invaded Lebanese territory. A condition that had prevailed for seven years was abruptly changed. But it was during those seven years preceding the invasion that the fabric of Lebanese society had begun to unravel, making room for a transformed national consciousness. <br><br>

                                        <p>  Much of the military tension between Zgharta and Tripoli was attributed to the Liberation Army of Zgharta (later renamed the Marada Forces, after the supposed ancestors of the Maronites), commanded by President Franjiyeh’s son Tony. When the army intervened to create a buffer zone between the two northern cities, it was accused of complicity with Zgharta. A call for a general strike by the LNM against the intervention of the army in the north provoked a new round of fighting in Beirut, in which the Phalange took the initiative to bombard the downtown district of the city, while their spokesperson declared that the fighting would not stop until the Lebanese army was deployed.

							<div class="info amateur check">
								<h2>Check</h2>
								<p>During a check, players enter a meditative state with small peaks of Theta activity in the right frontal cortex.</p>
								<p>This indicates that players viewed the check as an automatic process but instilled an emotional attachment to it, in anticipation as to how the subsequent play would unfold.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="info amateur raise">
								<h2>Raise</h2>
								<p>A raise caused players to enter a state of heightened alertness with a sharp spike in <strong>Beta</strong> activity. The right frontal lobe experienced the highest level of activity, driven by the emotional impact that a raise has on other players.</p>
								<p>This enforces the psychology behind such a play, and activity is further increased during a bluff play.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="info amateur call">
								<h2>Call</h2>
								<p>When players call, the brain registers intermediate levels of Alpha activity.</p>
								<p>This demonstrates that a Call is interpreted as a relatively safe play, requiring only a relaxed alertness.</p>
								<p>The division of brain activity across both sides of the frontal lobes show that the call is both a logical and emotional tactic.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="info amateur allin">
								<h2>All in</h2>
								<p>An all-in is both a tactical and emotional play – results demonstrated that even when bluffing, <strong>Beta</strong> levels were high in both sides of the frontal lobes.</p>
								<p>As this play can make or break a player, this causes high emotional activity within the right frontal lobe.</p>
							</div>

							<!-- EXPERT DESCRIPTION -->

							<div class="info expert deal">
								<h2>Deal</h2>
								<p>Differing from lower-level players, expert players showed small spikes of Alpha activity. </p>
								<p>This activity demonstrates a relaxed yet thoughtful alertness, in stark contrast to amateur players who were extremely active with spikes in Beta brainwaves and beginners who were considerably more relaxed, only showing Theta brainwaves. </p>

Simultaneously, the first attacks were launched against the Karantina (Quarantine) and Maslakh (the public slaughterhouse) shantytowns on Beirut’s northern coast. The Joint Forces of the LNM and the PLO responded by laying siege to Damur on the coast of the Shouf, a Maronite-majority town of some 20,000 inhabitants that controlled the Beirut–Sidon road. Sham`un, entrenched nearby in his villa at Sa`diyat, ordered the army and the air force to defend Damur. Karantina fell to the Phalange militias on 22 January 1976, and two days later the Joint Forces invaded Damur, Sa`diyat and Jiyeh. Massacres were committed in both cases.

								</div>
								<div class="glossary changeable check">
									<p>The Check play elicits little brain activity from any of the skill levels, as each relies on a state of automation. The only notable variance is left-hand dominance in the expert player who is using logic to determine if the play is actually worth even playing a Check.</p>
									<h2>Tip:</h2>
									<p>A check should simply act as a signifier of the player wanting to continue play without any real strategic consideration; hence the low brain activity. Amateurs and beginners should avoid relying on a check too often as this may lend itself to experienced players reading your overall strategy.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="glossary changeable raise">
									<p>During a raise, all players will see a spike in Beta activity, demonstrating that no matter the skill levels, this is still a decisive play that forces others to respond. As the skill level improves, the level of activity decreases, suggesting that the Expert will be less threatened by such a move and able to read the play more effectively.</p>
									<h2>Tip:</h2>
									<p>Players should avoid being led by their emotional reaction and instead utilise their logic to determine why they should raise (or another player has raised). A raise should signify to other players that you have a strong hand and is a strong strategy to psyche out players during the Flop. Additionally, the raise should be used to successfully demonstrate a powerful hand before it is utilised as a bluffing strategy.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="glossary changeable call">
									<p>The Call can often be one of the most surprising plays in a poker game, demonstrating that the player is confident and keen to go head-to-head with the competitor. Whilst this may spook a bluffing player into making the wrong move, it can also be a weak move that creates no added decision points for other players. As can be seen by the brain visualisations, overall activity is relatively low and decreases with improved skill levels. The dominance of Alpha brainwaves demonstrates that players’ alertness is increased, with bilateral activity further showing that players are carefully considering this move.</p>
									<h2>Tip:</h2>
									<p> Whilst calling can often quickly bring a play to its conclusion, it may also reduce the potential to build a larger pot. A call is typically the safe bet in a game of poker, but also closes off opportunities to read other players – it’s key to use calls sparingly and only when you are keen to close the betting (ultimately for a confident win).</p>
								</div>
								<div class="glossary changeable allin">
									<p>The All In is the most confident play in a game of poker and signifies that you are prepared to bet everything on your hand. However, this can also be a costly bluff if you do not effectively read your fellow players. As expected, this generates the highest peaks of brain activity amongst the three skill levels. In particular, the beginner sees Beta activity throughout the whole brain, suggesting that they are stressed and potentially not thinking clearly. The expert player had lower levels of activity and seemed to rely on experience.</p>
									<h2>Tip:</h2>
									<p> Don’t let yourself be scared or threatened by the All In play; if another player tries to force your hand, you need to be confident that your hand will be a winner. If, however, you are the one playing the all in, never use it as a last-ditch attempt. Simply survey the community cards, evaluate the amounts that fellow players are betting and try to understand their emotions (and brain activity!) to ensure you make the right call.</p>

			<p>The research for this content was commissioned in 2014 by <a href="index.html">PartyPoker</a> and completed by market research firm, SimpleUsability Ltd. The research comprised:</p>
			<ul class='modal-list'>
				<li>Several PartyPoker members of varying levels of skill and experience are equipped with an Electroencephalography (EEG) headset</li>
				<li>Members are then asked to play a 40 minute session of online poker under observation, which is recorded both via camera and activity on the screen</li>
				<li>This was then directly compared with captured data from the EEG monitor to identify which plays and situations cause certain reactions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The output from the EEG headset was visualised using a specialist suite of Emotiv software designed to show levels of engagement, frustration and short and long term excitement across all areas of the brain.</p>
			<p>Brainwave states are recorded directly from electrical activity arising from the brain and synthesised using the Emotiv measurement suite into the measures of frustration, engagement and excitement;</p>
			<p><span>Frustration:</span> This measure can often correlate with anger, confusion or other negative states.</p>
			<p><span>Engagement:</span> This measure is neutral in nature and relates to stimulation, interest, novel experiences, memory, concentration, and general mental effort.</p>
			<p><span>Excitement:</span> This measure relates to positive psychophysical arousal e.g. heart rate increase, pupil dilation and sweat gland stimulation.</p>
			<p>Short term excitement shows a measure of excitement, which is instantaneous to the events causing excitement, for example, winning a hand.</p>
			<p>Long term excitement uses a weighted running average of short term excitement to more closely reflect the overall emotional state over time.</p>
			<p>The real-time brain maps show the location and intensity of mental activity in four frequency bands:</p>
			<ul class='modal-list'>
				<li><span>Delta (0.5-4Hz):</span> Indicating deep sleep, restfulness, and conversely excitement or agitation when delta waves are suppressed.</li>
				<li><span>Theta (4-8Hz):</span> Indicating deep meditative states, daydreaming and automatic tasks.</li>
				<li><span>Alpha (8-15Hz):</span> Indicating relaxed alertness, restful and meditative states.</li>
				<li><span>Beta (15-30Hz):</span> Indicating   wakefulness,   alertness,   mental engagement and conscious processing of information.</li>
